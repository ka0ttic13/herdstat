ChangeLog for herdstat

2005-04-19 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* configure.ac: Updated version (1.1.0_pre2)

2005-04-18 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* src/formatter.cc: fixed bug in append(string, vector) that caused an
	abort if data.size() == 0.  Thanks to tove for the heads up.
	* lib/portage_misc.cc, lib/portage_misc.hh: Move find_package to
	find_package_in and make find_package take a config_T object and call
	find_package_in for PORTDIR and PORTDIR_OVERLAY's.  Moved
	search_overlays here from meta action handler.  Also added an
	overloaded ebuild_which that takes a portdir.  The original
	ebuild_which now does it's work and then calls the new ebuild_which
	for each portdir.  This fixed a bug where the metadata would be
	retrieved from one directory and the ebuild data from another (in the
	case of an overlay).
	* src/action_meta_handler.cc, src/action_versions_handler.cc: Modified
	to use new find_package() which means it now respects PORTDIR_OVERLAY
	as it should.  Modified meta handler to display any overlays that any
	queries came from.

2005-04-16 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* src/action_versions_handler.cc, src/action_versions_handler.hh:
	Added versions action handler for just displaying package versions.

	* configure.ac: Updated version (1.1.0_pre1)
	* lib/vars.cc, lib/vars.hh: Fixed bug where any reference to a
	variable not yet in the var map would not get replaced.  Added subst()
	method to accomplish this, which recursively calls itself until all
	variable occurences have been replaced (unless we can't find it of
	course).
	* src/options.cc: Instead of saving portage::config_T::portdir(), save
	the config_T object itself.
	* lib/portage_config.hh: Added a operator<< for portage::config_T so
	that it can properly be stored in option_T::option_map_T.  Dumps
	entire portage config along with the rest of our options when --debug
	is specified.
	* src/action_meta_handler.cc: Fixed bug that caused funky formatting
	in --metadata output when multiple url's are listed in ${HOMEPAGE}.
	Added search_overlays().

2005-04-15 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* lib/file.hh: Added bool util::path_T::exists().
	* src/herds_xml.cc, src/herds_xml.hh, src/herdstat.cc,
	src/action_dev_handler.cc, src/action_dev_handler.hh,
	src/action_herd_handler.cc, src/action_herd_handler.hh,
	src/action_meta_handler.cc, src/action_meta_handler.hh,
	src/action_pkg_handler.cc, src/action_pkg_handler.hh,
	src/action_stats_handler.cc, src/action_stats_handler.hh,
	src/action_which_handler.cc, src/action_which_handler.hh,
	src/action_handler.hh: Moved all fetching and parsing logic into it's
	own class, herds_xml_T.  We no longer parse herds.xml in main() which
	means we no longer need to pass a herds_T to all the action handlers.
	Instead we have each action handler that needs it create an instance
	of herds_xml_T which will take care of any fetching/parsing.
	* src/options.cc: Removed "parse herds.xml" and "herds.xml" options
	since they're no longer necessary.
	* src/herds_xml_handler.hh: Removed unnecessary exists() member.
	* bashcomp: Updated to cache output of 'herdstat -q all' and 'herdstat
	-dq all'.  Fixed bug where if any previous option contained a 'm' or
	'q' it would assume -m or -q were specified and complete
	appropriately.

2005-04-14 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* lib/util.cc, lib/util.hh, lib/file.cc, lib/file.hh: Moved copy_file
	and move_file to file.{cc,hh}.
	* src/action_meta_handler.cc, src/action_which_handler.cc,
	src/herdstat.cc: catch ambiguous_pkg_E and nonexistent_pkg_E in
	action_{which,meta}_handler instead of main() so we can continue in
	the opts loop if opts > 1.
	* lib/file.cc: Use a for loop instead of std::copy and and an
	ostream_iterator for file_T::display since for some reason it isn't
	copying the entire vector to the stream.

2005-04-13 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* lib/portage_exceptions.hh: Added ambiguous_pkg_E and
	nonexistent_pkg_E exceptions.
	* lib/portage_misc.cc, lib/portage_misc.hh: Modified find_package() to
	return the full category/package string instead of a vector of
	possibles.  find_package() now throws ambiguous_pkg_E() or
	nonexistent_pkg_E() where appropriate instead of making the caller
	handle it.
	* src/action_meta_handler.cc: Removed possibles handling code now that
	find_package handles it.
	* src/action_which_handler.cc: Added "which" action handler which is
	comparable to running 'equery which' but maybe a tad faster.  With the
	new versions_T/version_string_T classes, this is too trivial not to
	add.
	* src/options.hh: Added option_which to options_actions_T.
	* src/herdstat.cc: Added --which option.
	* bashcomp, doc/herdstat.1.in: Updated for --which.

2005-04-12 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* lib/portage_version.cc, lib/portage_version.hh: Added
	version_nosuffix_T for representing ${PV} minus the suffix.
	version_string_T::operator< now uses version_nosuffix_T::operator< for
	comparison instead of simple string comparison, and thus is now more
	reliable.
	* lib/portage_misc.cc: Updated ebuild_which() to use newly finished
	versions_T/version_string_T classes.

2005-04-11 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* lib/portage_version.cc, lib/portage_version.hh: Finally have the
	version sorting code working.

2005-04-09 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* lib/string.cc, lib/string.hh: Added string class which inherits from
	std::string.  For now just provides the split() member function.
	* lib/file.cc, lib/file.hh: Added generic directory container from
	which we derive two types (dirobject_T formerly known as dir_T and
	dir_T which just hold's the filenames not whole file objects. Also
	added path_T to represent path strings.

2005-04-07 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* lib/portage_misc.cc, lib/portage_misc.hh, src/categories.hh,
	src/action_meta_handler.cc: Moved categories_T to portage namespace.
	Also moved get_possibles() to portage::find_package().
	* lib/portage_version.cc, lib/portage_version.hh: Added
	version_string_T and the plural version versions_T.
	* lib/string.cc, lib/string.hh: Added vec2str() for converting a
	vector of strings into a string delimited by the specified delimiter.
	* lib/portage_misc.cc, lib/portage_misc.hh, lib/portage_config.cc,
	lib/portage_config.hh: Put portage stuff into it's own namespace.
	* lib/file.cc, lib/file.hh: delete stream on close(). Also added
	chop_fileext() for chopping file extensions.
	* lib/vars.cc: Modified read() to open stream if stream is NULL.
	* lib/portage_config.hh: Rename portage_config_T to config_T now that
	it resides in the portage namespace.  Modified config_T to work nicely
	with new modified vars_T.
	* src/herdstat.cc: Removed errant duplicate formatter_T declaration.
	Also moved the very large try...catch block for fetching herds.xml to
	it's own function, fetch_herds_xml().
	* src/action_pkg_handler.cc: Fix bug where progress was displayed if
	-pq <non-existent> was specified.
	* src/formatter.cc, src/formatter.hh: Added quiet_delim member to
	formatter_T::attrs_T for allowing the caller to choose which delimiter
	is used in quiet output (defaults to '\n').
	* src/action_meta_handler.cc: Removed all the special quiet code that
	was required before formatter_T's quiet_delim member was added.

2005-04-06 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* lib/file.cc, lib/file.hh: Finished up file_T methods.
	* src/categories.hh, src/cache.hh, src/action_meta_handler.cc,
	src/metadatas.cc, src/metadatas.hh: Updated to use file_T/dir_T.

2005-04-05 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* tags/release-1.0.3: copy tags/release-1.0.2 and backport bug fixes.
	* tags/release-1.0.3/configure.ac: Update version (1.0.3 release).

	* lib/file.cc, lib/file.hh: Added file/dir objects and moved
	file-related util functions here.
	* lib/progress.hh: Moved progress_T to it's own header.
	* lib/util.cc, lib/util.hh: Tidy! moved a lot of the file-related util
	functions to file.{cc,hh}.

2005-04-04 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* lib/util.cc, lib/util.hh, lib/vars.cc, lib/vars.hh: added vars_T and
	removed get_*_var().

2005-04-03 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* lib/portage_misc.cc, lib/portage_misc.hh: Added
	get_version_components().
	* src/util.cc, src/util.hh, lib/util.cc, lib/util.hh, lib/string.cc,
	lib/string.hh, lib/vars.cc, lib/vars.hh, lib/timer.hh,
	lib/util_exceptions.hh, lib/portage_misc.cc, lib/portage_misc.hh,
	lib/portage_config.hh: broke up util.{cc,hh} into it's own convenience
	lib.
	* src/cache.hh: Added new cache_T class, broken out from the caching
	code in metadatas.cc.
	* src/metadatas.cc: Use cache_T.
	* src/util.cc: Modified copy_file to use istream/ostream_iterator's.
	* src/categories.hh: Using cache_T, categories_T is now even more
	trivial, as the categories file is really just a manual cache.

2005-04-02 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* src/metadatas.cc: Fixed bug where new timestamp isnt copied when
	md5sum fails.
	* src/action_meta_handler.cc: Don't display colors in the ambiguous
	package warning when --quiet.
	* src/action_pkg_handler.cc: Fix bug where first package of list was
	displayed when --count was specified.

2005-04-01 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* configure.ac: Update version (1.0.2 release).
	* src/metadatas.cc: If $PORTDIR/metadata/timestamp exists, dont
	re-cache the metadata.xml list until it changes.
	* src/util.cc, src/util.hh: Modified get_ebuild_var() to handle
	HOMEPAGE specially, doing variable substituion in an attempt to
	produce readable HOMEPAGE output.  Also added a plural version of
	get_var(), get_vars() since it's not practical to open the same file
	many times.  Added md5check().
	* src/action_meta_handler.cc: Instead of throwing an instance of
	args_usage_E if -m is specified w/no non-opt args, print a message
	telling the user they must be in a package directory or category.
	Added a few comments.  Added --quiet support for pythonhead.
	* src/action_pkg_handler.cc: Fixed bug where first package was
	displayed w/no color while the rest were blue when --verbose.

2005-03-31 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* src/categories.hh: Added new categories_T class.
	* src/metadatas.cc: Modified to use new categories_T.
	* src/action_meta_handler.cc: Display ebuild's DESCRIPTION and
	HOMEPAGE even if no metadata.xml exists.  Allow user to run 'herdstat
	-m' with no non-opt args *IF* in a package directory or category.
	* src/exceptions.hh: Added errno_error_E and modified bad_fileobject_E
	to derive from it.
	* src/util.cc, src/util.hh: Added getcwd(). Moved get_categories() to
	it's own categories_T class.

2005-03-30 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* doc/herdstat.1.in, bashcomp: Added --with-herd.
	* src/util.cc, src/util.hh: Added a generic get_var() for retrieving
	variables from files using rcfile_T. Modified portdir() to use it.
	Added ebuild_which() which haphazardly tries to determine the latest
	ebuild of a package (does a crappy job).  I'll write a real version
	parser if 100% accuracy is needed.  Added get_ebuild_var() which uses
	get_var() to retrieve a variable value from an ebuild.
	* src/action_meta_handler.cc: Modified to show ebuild DESCRIPTION if
	metadata longdesc is non-existent. Also show HOMEPAGE if non-empty.
	* src/herdstat.cc: Catch std::runtime_error when trying to set a non-C
	locale, print an error, and exit.
	* src/options.cc, src/herdstat.cc, src/action_pkg_handler.cc: Added a
	--with-herd option, a generalization of --no-herd.  --no-herd will be
	kept around and will be considered shorthand for --with-herd=no-herd.

2005-03-27 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* configure.ac: Updated version (1.0.1-release).
	* doc/herdstat.1.in, bashcomp: Updated for --metadata and --no-herd.
	* src/action_pkg_handler.cc, src/options.cc: Added --no-herd option
	for only displaying packages in herd "no-herd".
	* src/action_meta_handler.cc, src/action_meta_handler.hh: Added
	metadata handler for looking up package/category metadata (--metadata).
	* src/options.cc: Added 'parse herds.xml' option since
	action_meta_handler will not need to parse herds.xml. Also added
	action_meta to action_options_T.
	* src/util.hh: Renamed status_T to progress_T. Modified it to not
	print leading zeros.
	* src/metadatas.cc, src/metadatas.hh: Moved metadata.xml retrieval
	code from action_pkg_handler.cc into it's own class.
	* src/action_pkg_handler.cc: Moved metadata.xml retrieval code to
	metadatas.{cc,hh}.  Also reworked the way we handle invalid
	devs/herds.  Got the progress thinggy to work as it should when
	parsing metadata.xml's.

2005-03-26 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>
	
	* configure.ac: Update version (1.0-release).
	* src/util.hh: Added status_T class for showing percent of task
	completion.
	* src/action_pkg_handler.cc: Use util::status_T for metadata caching
	and parsing.

2005-03-25 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* src/util.cc: Use C++ version of std::isspace and std::tolower with
	locale.

2005-03-24 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* configure.ac: Update version (1.0_rc2-release).
	* src/action_pkg_handler.cc: Modified get_metadatas() to cache the
	list of metadata.xml's for 24hrs; This should make subsequent queries
	a lot faster.
	* src/herds_xml_handler.cc, src/metadata_xml_handler.cc, src/herds.cc,
	src/devs.hh, src/action_pkg_handler.cc: Call util::tidy_whitespace()
	for only the data shown, not ALL data when filling the containers.
	This should make a slight dent in elapsed runtime.
	* src/formatter.cc: Added a sleu of debug_msg calls to aid in
	debugging. Fixed formatting bug causing some lines to not wrap and
	indent properly.

2005-03-23 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* src/herdstat.cc: Add formatter_T::set_highlightcolor() and
	formatter_T::add_highlight() calls.  Removed unnecessary remove_if()
	call.
	* src/herds.cc: Remove highlighting stuff since we do it in main()
	now.
	* src/action_stats_handler.cc, src/action_herd_handler.cc,
	src/action_pkg_handler.cc, src/action_dev_handler.cc, src/util.cc:
	s/size_t/std::size_t/.
	* src/action_pkg_handler.cc: Fix small formatting issue (errant \n).

2005-03-22 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* configure.ac: Update version (1.0_rc1-release).
	* bashcomp, doc/herdstat.1.in, src/herdstat.cc, src/options.cc:
	Added --nocolor.
	* src/formatter.cc: Fixed a few bugs to allow --nocolor to work as
	expected.  Moved append() to private, and added operator() as an
	interface. Also moved format_attrs_T and highlight() private.

2005-03-21 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* src/exceptions.hh: Revert gcc-4 fixes since gcc-3.3.x has a broken
	va_start macro, causing numerous warnings.

2005-03-19 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* src/action_dev_handler.cc: Fixed too low maxlabel value causing an
	exception when '-d all' is specified.

2005-03-18 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* configure.ac: Updated version (release-0.6).
	* doc/herdstat.1.in: Added --count and a couple examples.
	* bashcomp: Updated to allow --dev and --package to be specified at
	the same time. Also added --count.
	* src/options.cc: Added dev and count option.
	* src/herdstat.cc: Allow both --dev and --package to be specified at
	the same time in order to allow us to look up packages belonging to a
	certain developer. Added --count option.
	* src/action_pkg_handler.cc: Added developer support so that
	specifying --dev and --package will work.  Also added --count support.
	* src/action_dev_handler.cc: Removed check for dev w/o email address
	since metadata_xml_handler_T now handles that. Also added --count
	support.
	* src/action_herd_handler.cc: Added --count support.
	* src/herds.cc: Added --count support.
	* src/formatter.hh: Added size() method for returning the current
	buffer size.

2005-03-17 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* src/formatter.cc, src/formatter.hh: Added highlighting
	functionality.  New functions highlight(), add_highlight(),
	set_highlightcolor(), highlightcolor().  Added vector to
	format_attrs_T for storing words we should highlight on.
	* src/herds.cc: Remove nasty highlighting hack since it's now
	incorporated in formatter_T.
	* src/devs.hh: Added name & role members.  Only data other than those
	two will be stored in the dev_attrs_T vector.
	* src/herds_xml_handler.cc: Store name and role in respective
	dev_attrs_T members instead of the vector.
	* src/action_dev_handler.cc: Display developer's full name (if
	available) and their email address.
	* src/action_pkg_handler.cc: Fixed bug where a newline would get
	displayed after a herd, even if the number of pkgs in that herd == 0.

2005-03-16 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* src/herdstat.cc: Ignore --quiet if invoked with no other arguments.
	* bashcomp: Added 2>/dev/null to any herdstat invocations so that no
	errors (failed to fetch fex) show up in the completions.
	* src/util.cc, src/util.hh: Added lowercase().
	* src/herds_xml_handler.cc: Run developer username through
	util::lowercase() before saving it.  Should get rid of another
	duplicate or two.

2005-03-15 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* src/exceptions.hh: va_start doesn't necessarily need a const char *.
	Thanks to azarah for helping me with this.  This fix gets rid of the
	only remaining gcc-4 warnings.

	* configure.ac: Update version (release-0.5).
	* NEWS: Update for 0.5 (and forgot to update for 0.4).
	* src/formatter.hh: Added peek() member function for peeking at the
	last element of formatter_T's internal buffer.
	* src/action_pkg_handler.cc: Fixed borked --package output (extra
	newlines should only be included in --verbose output where package
	<longdesciption>'s are displayed.
	* src/action_stats_handler.cc, src/action_stats_handler.hh: Added new
	action handler which shows a nice summary of statistics.  This handler
	is called if no arguments are specified on the command-line.
	* src/options.hh: Added action_stats to options_action_T enum.
	* src/herdstat.cc: Added action_stats_handler_T to the handler list.
	Also fixed bug where backup copy of fetched herds.xml wasn't removed.
	* src/Makefile.am: Added action_stats_handler.{cc,hh} to source list.

2005-03-14 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* configure.ac: Update version (release-0.4).
	* src/util.cc, src/util.hh: Added collapse_whitespace() which
	collapses any consecutive whitepsace, strips leading/trailing
	whitespace, and converts any '\n''s in the middle into spaces.
	* src/herds_xml_handler.cc, src/metadata_xml_handler.cc: Run data
	through util::collapse_whitespace() while parsing and store the
	result.
	* src/options.cc, src/options.hh: Added generic container for holding
	options (option_type_T). options_T now holds an internal static map of
	strings (option names) and their corresponding data in whatever type
	it is.
	* src/exceptions.hh: Added base herdstat class for bad_casts and added
	bad_option_cast_E and invalid_option_E exceptions.
	* src/action_dev_handler.cc, src/action_herd_handler.cc,
	src/action_pkg_handler.cc, src/herds.cc, src/devs.hh, src/herdstat.cc:
	Updated to use new options interface.

2005-03-13 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* doc/herdstat.1.in, bashcomp: Updated for --fetch.

2005-03-11 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* src/util.cc, src/util.hh: Don't use wget -q if --verbose.
	* src/herdstat.cc: Set the common format attrs here. Also added new
	option --fetch.
	* src/options.cc, src/options.hh: Added option fetch.
	* src/formatter.cc: Added quiet to format_attrs_T. Updated both
	append() functions to use it. In flush(), use remove_copy() and an
	ostream_iterator instead of a loop.
	* src/herds.cc, src/action_herd_handler.cc, src/action_dev_handler.cc,
	src/action_pkg_handler.cc: Removed a lot of the options_T::quiet()
	checks since formatter_T now handles *most* of it.

2005-03-10 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* Makefile.am: Added TODO target for automatically generating the TODO
	file with devtodo.
	* src/herds_xml_handler.cc: append '@gentoo.org' to email addresses
	that lack it.
	* src/util.cc: Make current_user() return the whole email address.
	* src/herds.cc, src/herds.hh: Added herd_T::keys(); cleaned up
	herd_T::display() a little.
	* src/xmlparser.hh: Added a few comments.

2005-03-09 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* configure.ac: Update version (release-0.3).
	* bashcomp: Fixed the two errant ')' causing 'all' completion to
	complete to 'all\)'.  Also, moving out of distribution and into the
	portage tree for easier access.
	* doc/herdstat.1.in: Updated for --outfile.
	* src/herdstat.cc: Added new command-line option --outfile.
	* src/herds.cc: Fix bug where yellow user highlighting doesn't occur
	in verbose output. Also fixed another bug where output was being sent
	to stdout instead of the stream arg if options.quiet().
	* src/devs.hh: Fix dev_attrs_T::display() to only display all
	developer attributes if option all is not set.
	* src/options.cc, src/options.hh: Added options all, outfile, and
	outstream.
	* src/action_herd_handler.cc, src/action_dev_handler.cc,
	src/action_pkg_handler.cc: Updated to use options_T::outstream()
	instead of std::cout.

2005-03-08 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* configure.ac: Update version (release-0.2).
	* doc/herdstat.1.in: Added a few more examples.
	* src/util.cc, src/util.hh: Added copy_file(), move_file(), and
	get_user_from_email().
	* src/herdstat.cc: Use cached copy of herds.xml if it exists and we
	are unable to fetch it.
	* src/herds.cc: Highlight current user's nick *after* sorting,
	otherwise the highlighted nick will always be at the beginning of the
	vector.

2005-03-07 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* bashcomp: Now that the 'all' target is completed, we can now use it
	to generate our completions!
	* doc/herdstat.1.in: Added a non-option args section to explain them.
	Also added the info relevant to the all target.
	* src/herdstat.cc: Added herds.xml filesize check as it seems wget
	will write a 0 byte file if fetching fails, rather than return an
	exit code.
	* src/action_pkg_handler.cc: Display a small message at the beginning
	of operator() to give the user a hint as to why it might be taking a
	while.  Also, added check early on to make sure herd exists before
	going through the trouble of getting the list of metadatas.
	* src/action_dev_handler.cc: Added support for the 'all' target.
	* src/action_herd_handler.cc: Fixed to respect --quiet when 'all'
	target is specified.
	* src/herds.cc: Only display name,desc, and email members of herd_T if
	they're not empty.
	* src/util.cc, src/util.hh: Moved the ECHANGELOG_USER check here in
	current_user().

2005-03-06 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* src/types.hh: Moved to devs.hh.
	* src/devs.hh: Moved from types.hh.
	* src/herds.cc, src/herds.hh: Moved content handler stuff to
	herds_xml_handler.{cc,hh}. Added display() member functions.
	* src/herds_xml_handler.cc, src/herds_xml_handler.hh: Moved from
	herds.{cc,hh}.
	* src/metadata.cc, src/metadata.hh: Moved to
	metadata_xml_handler.{cc,hh}.
	* src/metadata_xml_handler.cc, src/metadata_xml_handler.hh: Moved from
	metadata.{cc,hh}.
	* src/herdstat.cc, src/action_handler.hh, src/action_dev_handler.hh,
	src/action_herd_handler.hh, src/action_pkg_handler.hh: Only pass the
	herds_T object not the whole handler now that we properly store the
	herd desc in the herd_T object.
	* src/action_dev_handler.cc, src/action_herd_handler.cc,
	src/action_pkg_handler.cc: Updated with all the changes; moved most of
	the displaying code to the appropriate display() member function.

2005-03-05 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* src/util.cc, src/util.hh: Added rcfile_T class originally written by
	Ciaran McCreesh for annodir.  Slightly modified to support quotes.
	Also added a portdir() function that tries to read
	make.conf/make.globals to determine PORTDIR. A *lot* faster than calling
	portageq.
	* src/herdstat.cc: Call util::portdir() to set the portdir.
	* src/action_pkg_handler.cc: Removed portageq popen.

2005-03-04 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* src/configure.ac: Update version (release-0.1).
	* doc/herdstat.1.in: Added example thanks to dragonheart.  Added
	PORTDIR and ECHANGELOG_USER to the Environment section.
	* src/herdstat.cc, src/action_dev_handler.cc,
	src/action_dev_handler.hh, src/action_pkg_handler.cc,
	src/action_pkg_handler.hh, src/action_herd_handler.cc,
	src/action_herd_handler.hh, src/action_handler.hh: Since all action
	handlers need to parse herds.xml for one reason or another, do it
	before calling the handler and then pass the data to the handler.
	* src/formatter.cc, src/formatter.hh: Added member functions for
	setting/getting attributes rather than having the caller set the
	attributes manually.

2005-03-03 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* README: Now has more content than "TODO".
	* doc/Makefile.am, doc/herdstat.1.in: Added.
	* src/exceptions.hh: Added timer_E.
	* src/action_dev_handler.cc: Finished; now works.
	* src/action_herd_handler.cc: Added some code to highlight the user's
	nick if it occurs in the output (uses ECHANGELOG_USER). Also colorize
	the email address, if verbose.
	* src/action_pkg_handler.cc: removed the second level opendir() stuff
	as it's totally unnecessary and overkill.  get_metadatas() is much
	faster now as a result.
	* src/xmlparser.hh: Added overloaded parse() that takes a stream.
	* src/util.cc, src/util.hh: Added is_dir() and is_file().

2005-03-02 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* src/action_dev_handler.cc, src/action_dev_handler.hh: Added template
	for new action handler for doing reverse lookups (by dev instead of
	herd).
	* src/herdstat.cc: Fix unique() call.
	* src/action_herd_handler.cc, src/action_pkg_handler.cc: Update to use
	new handlers and directly use XMLParser_T.
	* src/metadata.cc, src/metadata.hh: Move MetadataXMLParser_T to
	MetadataXMLHandler_T.
	* src/herds.cc, src/herds.hh: Move HerdsXMLParser_T to
	HerdsXMLHandler_T.
	* src/xmlparser.hh: XMLParser_T no longer inherits from
	xml::event_parser; added XMLHandler_T as an abstract handler type.
	* src/exceptions.hh: XMLParser_E now accepts two args, file and error
	string.
	* src/types.hh, src/herds.hh: Use typedef instead of classes for types
	devs_T, dev_attrs_T, and herds_T.
	* configure.ac: Use pkg-config for the xmlwrapp check.

2005-03-01 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>
	
	* src/exceptions.hh: Added base msg and va exception classes.

	* src/output.cc, src/output.hh: New files for output-related functions.
	* src/action_herd_handler.cc: Finished herd loop.
	* src/herdstat.cc: Use a vector to save all non-option arguments.
